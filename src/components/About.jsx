        I’m Avi, an undergraduate Software Engineering student passionate about building modern web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into functional projects and love exploring the latest tools and frameworks in web development. From designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing efficient backend systems, I strive to create applications that are both practical and visually appealing.

Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on several projects that challenged me to solve real-world problems. These experiences taught me how to break down complex tasks, work with diverse technologies, and approach problems creatively. I enjoy collaborating with others, learning from feedback, and continuously improving my skills to stay at the forefront of technology.

Beyond coding, I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to make an impact through software. I’m constantly experimenting with new technologies, reading about emerging trends, and exploring ways to apply my knowledge to meaningful projects. My goal is to grow as a versatile developer and contribute to solutions that positively affect people’s lives.
